# Hashmap Website

This is a Hashmap website that allows the user to test and fiddle with a hashmap on the website itself

## Technology Used

- JavaScript HashMap class that handles:
  - Hashing
  - Collision resolution with buckets
  - Dynamic resizing
- No frameworks or external dependencies — just good old fashion HTML code

## How to Start
- Open the Page itself to start no need for download

### Manipulating the Hashmap
- Type a key and value in the input fields.
- Click:
  - `Add/Update` to insert or update an entry
  - `Get` to fetch a value
  - `Remove` to delete an entry
  - `Clear` to wipe the map clean

You’ll see output messages and the full internal state of the `HashMap` update live.

## Features
### Odin Requirements
- Went a bit off the rails here, the requirements was to create a hashmap and just get it working to create an output in a terminal
### Extra Features
- The entire function of the website itself is extra as it was not listed in the requirement
- I allow the user to play around with the hashmap itself instead of looking at a fixed outcome now

## Future Work
- Already started by actually making a proper website component of this
- Probably make it a bit more compact

## Learning Outcomes
- A more in depth understand of hashmaps
- building a hashmap is one thing allowing users to use it in a website is another beast
