Should work just by downloading the html
from the html use inspect and go to console
There are no future improvements planned unless I need to save my grade

So turns out its saving grade time
I am not very great with creativity so I prompted Chatgpt with how to make this more than info that pops up in a terminal
It suggested making the very hashmap inside the website itself and letting the user build the hashmap themselves
So from the new website you can edit the hashmap table however you want with adding items with the key and value
you can take values and keys out with the delete
you can get information from it by inserting the key, hitting the get button then it will display what the value is
finally you can clear it all with the clear button
I don't exactly know how to show off future plans for this as it was just me in the beginning of class trying to take an easy project
the easy project should have been just done as a homework instead
Now both hashmap.js and jankwebsite whatever I named it are pretty much invalid, but I do want to leave them there to look back on until I can find a way to just have them comments of the past
